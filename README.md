# Sorting

**Bubblesort.java**

This algorithm gets input from the user until he quits. And then it performs the sorting in ascending order. In ascending
order sorting, the largest number gets sinked to the end of array after each iteration, and hence at the end of all the
iterations, the array is sorted.

**SelectionSort.java**

This algorithm gets input from the user until he quits. And then it performs the sorting in ascending order. It first
finds the smallest element and moves its position to one in the array. Then, it finds the second smallest element and
moves its position to two in the array, and so on, until all the elements are sorted.
